<h4 align="center">REDIRMASK - Advanced Link Masking Tool that allows you to disguise URLs</h4>

### DESCRIPTION
REDIRMASK is a powerful tool that allows you to disguise URLs, making them appear as legitimate links from well-known platforms. Whether you want to create a custom-masked URL or use pre-built templates to make your link look like a social media profile, a video share, or a file download, REDIRMASK provides a seamless way to achieve it.
Features

### Features

Two Masking Modes
  * Custom Masking – Manually set both the masked link and the target link.
  * Template Masking – Select from pre-built link formats like Facebook, Discord, YouTube, and more.

Realistic Link Formats Make your links appear as trusted domains 

Simple & Fast Usage: Just enter your target link and choose a masking method.

### How It Works

Mode 1: Custom Masking
    
    You provide:
    A mask link (the link you want the target to see).
    A target link (the real link where the user will be redirected).

    Example:
    Mask Link: https://google.com/search?q=free-money
    Target Link: https://scam-website.com/login

Mode 2: Template Masking

    You provide:
    A target link (the real destination).
    Select a pre-built template (e.g., Facebook, YouTube, Discord).

    Example:
    Target Link: https://yourwebsite.com/login
    Selected Template: Facebook Profile
